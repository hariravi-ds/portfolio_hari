Based in Washington, DC, and originally from Chennai, India, I bridge cultures and codeâ€”passionate about machine learning, cloud tech, and building tools that make businesses smarter.",
        "Data isnâ€™t just my jobâ€”itâ€™s my playgroundðŸš€. I thrive on building real-world solutions that drive impact. At MyEdMaster, Iâ€™m designing behavior-driven recommendation algorithms to better match equity-focused candidates with startups. Simultaneously, with Data Science for Sustainable Development, Iâ€™m helping optimize university-wide energy use through predictive modeling and anomaly detection, boosting sustainability outcomes with data.",
        "Previously, during my 2 years as a Member Technical Staff at Facilio, I helped develop a smart building management platform and engineered BI dashboards and APIs that improved customer satisfaction and system reliability.",
        "My stack includes Python, SQL, React.js, AWS, Tableau, and ML frameworks like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Iâ€™m also fascinated by NLP and ethical AI, and love using data to make smart systems smarter.",
        "When Iâ€™m not geeking out over data, I mentor peersâ€”leading Python bootcamps and hosting ML webinars to demystify tech for newcomers. I also serve as a Graduate Senator in the GWU Student Association, where I advocate for student needs and help shape initiatives that improve the graduate experience. Iâ€™m especially drawn to challenges where data can spark real-world change.",
